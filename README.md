# programming-exercises
This repository contains my solutions to programming exercises as detailed in my blog site (https://blackopscode.com/).

For now, these are selected lesson problems from Codility which are publicly available:
https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/1-iterations/

Take note that the "Case <#>" notation does not correspond to the Lesson numbers in Codility. It's a notation I made based on the order I solved the problems. 
Problems are arranged in folders to allow multiple files when solving using different programming languages (See Case 14 as an example). 
Also, the files does not contain the expected file extension as the contents are solely the actual texts entered in the input in Codility's online editor.
